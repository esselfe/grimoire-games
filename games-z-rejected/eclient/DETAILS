A Tale in the Desert is an online game set in ancient Egypt where players
work together to build the perfect society. It uses the internet to allow
thousands of players to play together in the same world. All of the
characters you will see and talk to in the game are controlled by other
people just like you, not by a computer. A Tale in the Desert is the first
online game to focus on long-term planning and long-term goals rather than
combat. Goals include the creation of great works of art and architecture,
becoming a powerful leader, and building wealth.
