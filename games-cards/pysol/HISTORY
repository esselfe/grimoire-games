	* DEPENDS: Needs tk and python built against tk

	* Thought process that lead to this thanks to Ben Ford :)
	* PREPARE: Don't use persistent_add for versions ;)
	  Default to 'y' for cardsets, sound, and music
	  Disable all of them as only sound-server can be downloaded :(
	  If someone has a copy of these we can put them on our mirror
	* DETAILS: Moved the setting of extra SOURCE information from PREPARE
	  Updated pysol-sound-server to 3.0.1
	* PRE_BUILD: Don't patch Makefile.patch
	* BUILD: No longer try to compile pysol (it's a script after all...)
	  Modify src/pysolaudio.py to make soundserver optional (copied from	
	  the pysol-compile.sh script)
	* INSTALL: Install scripts and data
	* Makefile,Makefile.patch,pysol-compile.sh: Removed
	* pysol: Added wrapper script

	* Thanks to
	  http://www.fedoraforum.org/forum/archive/index.php/t-2543.html
	  I've found the pysol source files (Markus no longer distributes, or
	  even works on, PySol) in pysol-devel from http://www.btree.org/linux/packages/fedora/core/2/i386/pysol-devel-4.82-2.noarch.rpm
	* pysol-compile.sh: Grabbed and modified from 
	  http://www.gophernet.org/projects/pysol-compile.sh
	* DETAILS: Added BUILD_API=2
	  Removed MAINTAINER
	  Download the -src as well, duh!
	  SOURCE2 is now for the data files (binaries, old SOURCE)
	* PREPARE: Converted to config_query
	* DEPENDS: Moved sound dependencies from PREPARE to DEPENDS
	* PRE_BUILD: Unpack SOURCE2 as well and increment other SOURCEs and MD5s
	  Apply Makefile.patch
	* BUILD: Converted to build_api 2
	  Build the source code
	* INSTALL: Branched from BUILD
	  Converted to build_api 2
	  Use $VERSION instead of hardcoding
	* Makefile: Removed
	* Makefile.patch: Added (smaller than copying the whole Makefile)
	* Makefile.sound: Updated python version to 2.4

2005-01-08 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
