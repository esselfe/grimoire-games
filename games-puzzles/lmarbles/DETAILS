LMarbles is an Atomix clone with a slight change in concept. Instead of
assembling molecules you create figures out of marbles. Nevertheless, the
basic game play is the same: If a marble starts to move it will not stop
until it hits a wall or another marble. To make it more interesting there are
obstacles like one-way streets, crumbling walls and portals.  As Marbles is
meant as a puzzle game you play against a move limit and not a time limit.
This way you have as much time as you need to think.
Further additions are available on the website. A manual
