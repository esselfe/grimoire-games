Symbolica is a remake of the C-64 game of the same name. It is targeted
to the Linux-based handhelds gp2x and N800, with a Linux/386 binary also
provided. It should compile under any operating system supported by SDL,
SDL_image, and SDL_ttf.  The symbols on the screen represent a numeric value
in the order they are displayed on the right. As you move over a symbol,
it decrements to the next lower symbol or disappears. Your job is to clear
the screen and move to the 'E' symbol.
