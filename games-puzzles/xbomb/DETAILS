cat << EOF
A minesweeper type game for X Windows, with some unusual, interesting and
challenging grid shapes.  The grids vary in difficulty.  The hexagonal grid is
the easiest of the three grids, although the endgame can be impossible. There
are 6 neighbours to each of the tiles.  The Square Grid is the traditional
grid shape. There are 8 neighbours to each of the tiles.  The Triangular
Grid is the most difficult of the three grids by a long way. There are 12
neighbours to each of the tiles.
