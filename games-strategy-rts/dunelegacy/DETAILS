Lead one of three interplanetary houses, Atreides, Harkonnen or Ordos, in an
attempt to harvest the largest amount of spice from the sand dunes. Exchange
your spice stockpiles for credits through refinement and build an army capable
of thwarting attempts of the other houses to stop your harvesting!
Dune Legacy is an effort by a handful of developers to revitalize the first-
ever real-time strategy game. The original game was the basis for the hugely
successful Command and Conquer series, and the gameplay has been replicated an
extended to a wide variety of storylines and series.
