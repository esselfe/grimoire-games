netPanzer is an online multiplayer tactical warfare game
designed for FAST ACTION combat. Gameplay concentrates
on the core -- no resource management is needed. The game
is based on quick tactical action and unit management in
real-time. Battles progress quickly and constantly as destroyed
players respawn with a set of new units. Players can join or
leave multiplayer games at any time.
