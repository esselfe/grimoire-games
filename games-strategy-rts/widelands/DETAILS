Widelands is a strategy game aiming for gameplay similar to Settlers II by
BlueByte. 
In this game, you start out on a small piece of land with nothing more than a
few of useful resources. Using those, you can build yourself an empire with
many thousands of inhabitants. On your way towards this goal, you will have to
build up an economic infrastructure, explore the lands around you and face
enemies who are trying to rule the world just like you do.
