	* BUILD, DEPENDS: made zlib, libpng, alsa and sdl optional
	* BUILD, CONFIGURE: made building with network support optional
	* FINAL, PREPARE: fixed the message to fit in 80 cols,
	  removed passages about data in ~/.openttd, since it won't work
	* INSTALL: put binary in /usr/libexec and script in /usr/games,
	  install images
	* openttd: the script is still needed, as openttd expects scenarios
	  in ~/.openttd/scenario and there doesn't seem to be a way to fix that,
	  also creates autosave directory,
	  removed the check for data, since openttd does that already, and in this
	  setup the user cannot provide his own
	* openttd.desktop: add the game to the menu in GNOME and other 
	  freedesktop.org compliant environments
