cat << EOF
Globulation 2 is an innovative high quality Real-Time Strategy [RTS],
which minimizes micro-management by automatically assigning tasks to
the units. The player has to choose the number of units he wants for
the different tasks, and the units will do their best to satisfy the
requests. This allows to manage more units and to focus on the strategy.
