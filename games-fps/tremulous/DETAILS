Tremulous is a free, open source game that blends a team based FPS with elements of an RTS. 
Players can choose from 2 unique races, aliens and humans. Players on both teams are able 
to build working structures in-game like an RTS. These structures provide many functions, 
the most important being spawning. The designated builders must ensure there are spawn structures 
or other players will not be able to rejoin the game after death. 
Other structures provide automated base defense (to some degree), healing functions and much more...

Player advancement is different depending on which team you are on. As a human, players are rewarded 
with credits for each alien kill. These credits may be used to purchase new weapons and upgrades 
from the "Armoury". The alien team advances quite differently. Upon killing a human foe, the alien 
is able to evolve into a new class. The more kills gained the more powerful the classes available.

The overall objective behind Tremulous is to eliminate the opposing team. This is achieved by not 
only killing the opposing players but also removing their ability to respawn by destroying their 
spawn structures.
