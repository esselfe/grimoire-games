EDuke32 is an awesome, free homebrew game engine and source port of the
classic PC first person shooter Duke Nukem 3D— Duke3D for short—to
Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, several handhelds, your family toaster,
and to your girlfriend's vibrator. We've added thousands of cool and useful
features and upgrades for regular players and additional editing capabilities
and scripting extensions for homebrew developers and mod creators.
