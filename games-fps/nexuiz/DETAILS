cat << EOF
Nexuiz is a 3d deathmatch game made entirely over the internet. The
purpose of the game is to bring deathmatch back to the basics, with
perfect weapon balancing and fast paced action, keeping itself away from
the current trend of realistic shooters. It uses HFX textures by Evil Lair,
and currently has 17 maps to frag in. With an advanced UI, the user can
select between 15 different player models to use, with an average of two
skins for each, and can connect to our master server to play people from
all over the world.
