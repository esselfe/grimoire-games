cat << EOF
Nexuiz is a 3d deathmatch game made entirely over the internet. The purpose of
the game is to bring deathmatch back to the basics, with perfect weapon
balancing and fast paced action, keeping itself away from the current trend of
realistic shooters. It uses HFX textures by Evil Lair, and currently has 17
maps to frag in. With an advanced UI, the user can select between 15 different
player models to use, with an average of two skins for each, and can connect
to our master server to play people from all over the world.
