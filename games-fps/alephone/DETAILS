Aleph One is an Open Source 3D first-person shooter game, based on the game
Marathon 2 by Bungie Software.  It supports, but doesn't require, OpenGL for
rendering.  Aleph One was originally a MacOS-only game, but I'm working on a
cross-platform version based on the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library,
that should eventually run on all systems supported by SDL (Linux, BeOS,
Windows, MacOS, Solaris, IRIX, *BSD, and others).

This spell does not include the game data files, and requires them to
play.  You can cast one of the two spells that are in the grimoire which
provide playable demo data:  AlephOne-m2 (the demo data for Marathon 2), or
AlephOne-minf (the demo data for Marathon Infinity), or you can provide your
own from a purchased CD of the game (http://www.bungie.com).
