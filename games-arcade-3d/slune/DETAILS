cat << EOF
Slune is a 3D game! It includes racing, car-crashing, and lots of action!
In addition, a multiplayer mode is available.

Slune relies on very original technical choices:
 * The game, the network engine and a part of the 3D engine are
   written in Python (whereas the other part of the 3D engine is
   in C),
 * The multiplayer mode is based on Peer-To-Peer, and not on
   client-server. No server is needed!
