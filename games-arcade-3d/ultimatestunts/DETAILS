UltimateStunts will be a remake of the famous DOS-game "stunts". This
DOS-game, which was released in the early 1990's, can be downloaded on
several abandonware sites, e.g. the XTC site. It is a 3D racing game,
with simple CGA/EGA/VGA graphics and no texture or smooth shading,
but because of the spectacular stunts (loopings, bridges to jump over,
etc.) it was really fun to play. One of the best aspects of this game
is that it had a track editor. Because of the tile-based tracks, every
gamer was able to make it's own tracks.

The remake won't become a DOS game: it will work on UNIX-compatible
systems (lik e Linux), and on windows. It will also provide more modern
features, like openGL graphics, 3D sound and internet multiplaying.
The current version is still in a pre-alpha fase, so you shouldn't expect
much of it, but the screenshots give a nice impression of how the game
will look.
