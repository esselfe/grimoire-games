        Update to 2.3.0

        Seems to have hardcoded 'prboom.wad' to the current
        directory, so I moved the binary prboom from /usr/games
        to /usr/share/games/doom and wrote a wrapper script
        to replace /usr/games.  prboom-game-server seems to
        work okay.

        Also sets the permissions correctly (root.games) for
        /usr/share/games/doom and it's binaries in /usr/games

        Checks md5sum for SOURCE2 (doom-1.8.wad.gz) during PRE_BUILD

        unpack for SOURCE2 doesn't seem to work, so it needs an
        additional gunzip -c to put the uncompressed doom wad
        (which the game wants named as doom1.wad) in SOURCE_DIRECTORY

		rewrote the last line of BUILD. Std. unpack function is not
		capable of handling .wad.gz files, gunzip -c is used instead.

		the name of the wad file is changed from doom-1.8.wad to
		doom1.wad. Prboom is not capable of handling more then
		one dot in the filename.
