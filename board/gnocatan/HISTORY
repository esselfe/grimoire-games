	* BUILD: After hearing people talking about this on
	IRC, I figured I'd try it, but what do I find?  It
	doesn't even run (segfaults) because it can't find
	it's pixmaps, which got installed to /usr/share/games/pixmaps,
	and the game itself got installed to /usr/share/games/games,
	so, I figured I'd fix it so I could try it, but now it's time
	for class, so adieu.
