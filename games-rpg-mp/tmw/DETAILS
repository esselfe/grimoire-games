cat << EOF
The Mana World (TMW) is a serious effort to create an innovative free and open
source MMORPG. TMW uses 2D graphics and aims to create a large and diverse
interactive world. It is licensed under the GPL, making sure this game can't
ever run away from you.

The project includes the development of both a client and a server, as well as
the development of an online world. At the moment we're making alpha releases
of the client, while our server is in early development. The eAthena free
software Ragnarok Online server is used until our own server has matured enough
to replace it.
