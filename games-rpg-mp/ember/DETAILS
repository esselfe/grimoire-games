Welcome to Ember! Ember is an effort to build a modularized framework for Worldforge clients which will run easily on different platforms.
  The Ember Game View can be renderized using different components, which could be used to have different views (text, 2D, iso, 3D with different engines) without rewriting the whole client.
  Currently there are two Game Views: the dime main view which uses SDL + OpenGL, and the OGRE view which uses the OGRE 3D engine.
