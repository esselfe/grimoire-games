Crossfire is a multi-player graphical arcade and adventure game made
for X. It has certain flavours from other games, especially Gauntlet
and the rogue-like games (Nethack, Moria, Angband, and Ragnarok). Any 
number of players can move around in their own window, finding and
using items and battling monsters. They can choose to cooperate or
compete in the same world.
