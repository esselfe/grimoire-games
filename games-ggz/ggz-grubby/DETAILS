cat << EOF
This package contains grubby, the almighty chatbot. It's a single binary, but
it is very flexible and extensible by plugins and scripts.

Grubby is intended to be used on servers so it doesn't miss players, but it is
in fact a client program. It reads all necessary startup information from
~/.ggz/grubby.rc and runs as long as it isn't shut down by its owner. See the
Setup file to view a common setup, or generate one using grubby-config.
