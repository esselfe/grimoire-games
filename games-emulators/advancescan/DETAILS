AdvanceSCAN is a command line rom manager for MAME, MESS, AdvanceMAME,
AdvanceMESS and Raine.

The main features are :

    * Directly read, write zip archives without decompressing and recompressing
      them for the best performance.
    * Add, copy, move and rename files in the zip archives. Any rom that you
      have is placed automatically in the correct zip.
    * Recognize the text files added by rom sites and delete them.
    * Recognize the text files added by the rom dumpers and keep or delete them.
    * It's safe. On all the zip operations any file removed or overwritten is
      saved in the 'rom_unknown', 'sample_unknown' directories and kept for
      future uses. This will prevent any unwanted remove operation.
    * Generate differential rom sets.
