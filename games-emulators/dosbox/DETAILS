DOSBox emulates an Intel x86 PC, complete with sound, graphics, mouse,
joystick, modem, etc., necessary for running many old MS-DOS games that
simply cannot be run on modern PCs and operating systems. However, it is
not restricted to running only games.

In theory, any MS-DOS or PC-DOS (referred to commonly as "DOS") application
should run in DOSBox, but the emphasis has been on getting DOS games to run
smoothly, which means that communication, networking and printer support are
still in early development.
