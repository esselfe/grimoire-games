FreedroidRPG is derived from the original classic Freedroid 
based on the game paradroid from the commodore 64.  In this game you 
are Tux, one of a race sentient penguins.  Humanity is in ruins due 
to the evil MegaSoft corporation and their original plans to rule the 
human race.  An attempt to use their omnipresent software to take 
over all droids, upon which humanity depended, backfired when the droids 
themselves became self-aware and decided to put forth their own plans 
for total domination.  As Tux, it is your job to restore things to 
their rightful place and undue the horrible, evil, and thouroughly 
inhumane things initiated by this MS corporation.
