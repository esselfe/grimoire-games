cat << EOF
XU4 is a recreation of the classic computer game Ultima IV. The
purpose of the project is to make it easy and convenient to play on
modern operating systems.  xu4 is primarily inspired by the much more
ambitious project Exult.  Linux is the primary development platform
but it gets ported to Windows regularly and is rumored to work on Mac
OS X, too.  It should be trivial to port to any system with SDL
support.

XU4 isn't a new game based on the Ultima IV story -- it is a faithful
recreation of the old game, right up to the crappy graphics.  If you
are looking for a game with modern gameplay and graphics, this is not
it -- yet.  New features that improve the gameplay and keep with the
spirit of the original game will be added.
