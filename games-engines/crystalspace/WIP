	Just a bit of a marker really. I am doing updating to the spell to try and get it updated and make finally ckecks to insure that it is installed 
	correctly so that CEL, and hopefully planeshift will be able to cast without any problems in the future.

	I looked inot the crystalspace engine today. It seems that pulling files directly from teh CVS repo caused more problems than it solved. Because 
ofthat I am reverting the change made to the DETAILS file in regards to teh SOURCE_URL and setting it back to teh way that it was. Also, in looking at 
the online documentation the DEPENDS file needed to be updated. Three programs where removed, and six were added. These files have been noted in teh 
HISTORY filein more detail, please view that file for more details. I will be updating the devel grimoire on p4 shortly and will continue to test the 
spell locally on my machine. When I am confident that all teh bugs have been worked out that I can find I will remove this WIP.
