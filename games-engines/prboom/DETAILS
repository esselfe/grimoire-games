PrBoom is a game engine - it provides a program to play Doom levels, but
it doesn't include any levels itself. More importantly, you need all the
sounds, sprites, and other graphics that make up the Doom environment.
So to play PrBoom, you need one of the main Doom date files from id
Software - either doom.wad, doom2.wad, tnt.wad or plutonia.wad from one
of the commercial Doom games, or the shareware doom1.wad. This file
is called the IWAD.
