2003-09-26 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* DETAILS: Update to 2.3.0
	* BUILD: Seems to have hardcoded 'prboom.wad' to the current
	  directory, so I moved the binary prboom from /usr/games
	  to /usr/share/games/doom and wrote a wrapper script
	  to replace /usr/games. prboom-game-server seems to
	  work okay.
	  Also sets the permissions correctly (root.games) for
	  /usr/share/games/doom and it's binaries in /usr/games
	* PRE_BUILD: Checks md5sum for SOURCE2 (doom-1.8.wad.gz)
	  unpack for SOURCE2 doesn't seem to work, so it needs an
	  additional gunzip -c to put the uncompressed doom wad
	  (which the game wants named as doom1.wad) in SOURCE_DIRECTORY

2003-09-20 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>

	* BUILD: rewrote the last line of BUILD. Std. unpack function is not
	  capable of handling .wad.gz files, gunzip -c is used instead.

	  doom1.wad. Prboom is not capable of handling more then
	  one dot in the filename.
