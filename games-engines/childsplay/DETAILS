Childsplay is a suite of educational games for young children, like gcompris,
but without the overkill of c/c++ and the gnome environment. Also the use of
the SDL libraries makes smooth animation and the playing of sound very easy.
Childsplay uses a plugin system for the games, so you might want to check the
Childsplay plugins page. (There are two built-in games: memory and a typing
game).
