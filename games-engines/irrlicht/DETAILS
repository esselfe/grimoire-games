cat << EOF
The Irrlicht Engine is an open source high performance realtime 3D engine
written in C++. It is completely cross-platform, using D3D, OpenGL and its
own software renderers, and has all of the state-of-the-art features which
can be found in commercial 3d engines. We've got a huge active community,
and there are lots of projects in development that use the engine. You can
find enhancements for Irrlicht all over the web, like alternative terrain
renderers, portal renderers, exporters, world layers, tutorials, editors,
language bindings for java, perl, ruby, basic, python, lua, and so on. And
best of all: It's completely free.
