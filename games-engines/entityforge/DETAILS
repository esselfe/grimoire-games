cat << EOF
EntityForge is a 3D graphical media display and manipulation tool.

It's intended for several uses:
  * WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) display of character models and animations in a game engine environment.
  * Conversion of character models and animations to and from various formats and packaging styles, with emphasis on Cal3D.
  * Limited model post-editing. (Material swaps, animation weighting, etc.)
  * Object composition for packaging and distribution by artists and world developers.

What actually works:
  * Load Cal3d model and animation sets and render in realtime, fully textured and in wireframe.
  * Animation 'tryout', including blending weight adjustments for multiple simultaneous animations.
  * Toggle rendering of individual meshes.
  * Arbitrarily change material assignments for individual meshes.
