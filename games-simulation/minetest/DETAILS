Minetest is an infinite-world block sandbox game and a game engine, inspired
by InfiniMiner, Minecraft and the like. It has been in development and use
since October 2010.

It is Free and Open Source Software, released under the LGPL 2.1 or later,
available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

Minetest is developed by a random bunch of lunatics.

Minetest is designed to be simple, stable and portable. It is lightweight
enough to run on fairly old hardware. It currently runs playably on a laptop
with Intel 945GM graphics. Though, as for the CPU, dualcore is recommended.

Features

* Walk around, dig and build in an infinite voxel world, and craft stuff
  from raw materials to help you along the way.
* Simplistic Modding API that supports many kinds of additions and
  modifications to the game.
* Multiplayer support for tens of players, via servers hosted by users.
* Voxel based lighting with gameplay consequences (light caves and buildings
  with torches)
* Almost infinite world and a beautiful map generator.
* Runs natively on Windows, Linux, OS X and FreeBSD.
* Supports multiple languages, translated by the community.
