Cultivation is a game about a community of gardeners growing food for themselves
in a shared space.

Cultivation is quite different from most other games. It is a social simulation,
and the primary form of conflict is over land and plant resources - there is
no shooting, but there are plenty of angry looks. It is also an evolution
simulation. Within the world of Cultivation, you can explore a virtually
infinite spectrum of different plant and gardener varieties.

All of the graphics, sounds, melodies,and other content in Cultivation are
100% procedurally generated at playtime. In other words, there are no
hand-painted texture maps - instead, each object has a uniquely "grown"
appearance. Every time you play, Cultivation generates fresh visuals, music
and behaviors.
