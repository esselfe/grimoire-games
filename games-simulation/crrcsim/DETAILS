Crrcsim is a model-airplane flight simulation program.  Using it, you can
learn how to fly model aircraft, test new aircraft designs, and improve your
skills by practicing on your computer. Some of it's features include:

* Open source
* Runs on GNU/Linux, Mac OSX (ppc and rosetta compatible) and Windows (98/2000/XP)
* 3D representation of the aircraft
* Very realistic flight model
* Nice graphics if you have a 3D accelerator card
* Great variety of how to control the model:
  - Use your R/C transmitter (connected to the parallel port, to the serial port
    via an "FMS PIC"-style cable or simply to your sound card's audio input)
  - Mouse
  - Joystick
  - Keyboard
  - Autopilot
