X-COM inspired turn based 3D strategy game

UFO: Alien Invasion is a strategy game featuring turn-based tactical
combat against hostile alien forces (human or computer controlled) which
are infiltrating earth at this very moment. You are in command of a small
special unit which has been founded to face the alien strike force. To be
successful in the long run, you must research the alien technology in order
to build bigger and better weapons against your foes.

'UFO: Alien Invasion' is heavily inspired by the 'X-COM' series by Mythos
and Microprose. The first game of the series, 'UFO DEFENSE', became a
classic and, in our honest opinion, is one of the best games ever made.
'UFO: Alien Invasion' is neither a sequel nor a remake of 'UFO DEFENSE' -
we simply had the urge to create a similar, turn-based strategy game. We
hope that it will be as entertaining as the original was us.
