ASC is a free, turn based strategy game. It is designed in the tradition of
the Battle Isle series from Bluebyte and is currently available for Windows
and Linux.
 ASC is distributed under the terms of the Gnu General Public License (the
 license Linux uses too),
which basically means the game is free, the complete source code is available
and you can do everything with it as long as it remains free.
