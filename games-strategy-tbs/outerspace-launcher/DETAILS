Outer Space Launcher.
Outer Space is an on-line strategy game which takes place in the dangerous
universe. The game is turn based, but also a kind of real time game. Turn
based because a turn is one hour (or two on week ends) ... real time because
the clock and the game don't stop when you go to sleep. Briefly, the objective
is to re-unite the galaxy after a catastrophic government collapse. Use your
skill and judgment as one of many prominent commanders to expand your empire,
construct buildings and ships, command large fleets, negotiate diplomatic
relations with other commanders, or wipe them out. Only the most skillful
commander will be able to re-unite the galaxy and be elected as the new
imperator!
