Freeciv is a multiuser reimplementation for Unix/X of the famous Microprose
game of Civilization. By default, the game is an improved Civ II, but this
can be customized; modpacks for near-100% compatibility with Civ I and Civ II
are included. Multiuser gameplay is real-time: in each turn, all human
players move concurrently. The game is designed to remain fairly playable
even on poor network connections. Freeciv can also be played on standalone
machines, and its AI players are a good challenge for beginners. The source
code comes with the server, three X clients, and non-X clients for MS Windows
and Amiga. Freeciv is released under the GNU General Public License. It is
maintained by an international team of coders and enthusiasts, and is easily
one of the most fun and addictive network games out there.
