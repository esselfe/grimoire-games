Crimson Fields is a tactical war game in the tradition of Battle Isle. Two
players command their units on a map of hexagons, trying to accomplish mission
objectives ranging from defending important locations to simply destroying all
enemy forces. Damaged units may be repaired or replaced by new recruits, while
victorious squadrons will improve their abilities so they will be even more
difficult to beat next time.

The game can be played against a human adversary in hot-seat mode or via
e-mail, or against a simple computer opponent.

The included editor can be used to create your own custom battlefields.
