Tux Paint" is a drawing program for young children. It has a simple interface
and fixed canvas size, and provides access to previous images using a thumbnail
browser (e.g., no access to the underlying filesystem).

Unlike popular drawing programs like "The GIMP," it has a very limited toolset.
However, it provides a much simpler interface, and has entertaining,
child-oriented additions such as sound effects.
