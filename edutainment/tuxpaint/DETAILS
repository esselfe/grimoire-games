cat << EOF
Tux Paint" is a drawing program for young children. It has a simple interface and fixed canvas size, 
and provides access to previous images using a thumbnail browser (e.g., no access to the underlying 
filesystem).

 Unlike popular drawing programs like "The GIMP," it has a very limited toolset. However, it provides 
a much simpler interface, and has entertaining, child-oriented additions such as sound effects.
