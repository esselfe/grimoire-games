Iter Vehemens ad Necem (IVAN) is a graphical roguelike game, which currently
runs in Windows, DOS and Linux. It features advanced bodypart and material
handling, multi-colored lighting and, above all, deep gameplay.
IVAN works pretty much in the same way as other roguelikes. The player
controls a character, which moves and attacks from the direction keys.
All other commands can be found by pressing ?-key in the game.

Q: What does "Iter Vehemens ad Necem" mean?
A: It's latin and means a "Violent Road to Death". For most players, that's
   a perfect description of the typical game.
