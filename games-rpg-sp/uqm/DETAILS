           SHORT="Port of Star Control II: The Ur-Quan Masters"
cat << EOF
The project started in August 2002, when Toys For Bob  released the sources of
Star Control 2 3DO version to the fan community. Our goal is to port
this wonderful game to current personal computers and operating systems. It is
and will remain 100% free of charge, and anyone can contribute to the project
and thus help make it even better.

Welcome aboard. Star Control II will take you on a far journey, a space odyssey
encompassing the realms of science-fiction and role-playing. This epic
adventure spans hundreds of light years, and evokes a history reaching back
over 250,000 years. As you travel out among the stars, your decisions and actions
will directly affect the destiny of 18 intelligent, star-faring species,
including the inhabitants of Earth. Star Control II is only in part a sequel to
Star Control, which focused exclusively on the strategy and tactics of the
bitter Ur-Quan Slave War (known by the philosophical as the Great Crucible of
Sentience). You need not have played the first game to enjoy this one.
However, if you have never fought a Star Control space-battle, you may wish to
practice with the SuperMelee game before facing enemy forces. The evil aliens
you will encounter are adept at the art of war, and unforgiving of weakness.
The history that follows details the critical involvement of Earth in the
conflict between the Alliance of Free Stars and the villainous Ur-Quan
Hierarchy. Study what happened, learn from the mistakes of those that went
before. Only in this way will you be prepared for the mystery, the intrigue
and the blazing action of Star Control II.
