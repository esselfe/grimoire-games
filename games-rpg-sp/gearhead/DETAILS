A century and a half ago the Earth was nearly destroyed by nuclear war. Now,
a federation of free city-states has begun to restore civilization. However,
there are forces operating in the darkness which will unleash the horrors
of the past age in a bid to determine the future of the human race.

Features of the game include random storyline generation, richly detailed
character generation, complex NPC interaction, and of course over 150 different
mechanical designs ranging from jet fighters to giant robots to city-smashing
tanks. GearHead is written in FreePascal and is open source. It compiles
for both Windows and Linux, and may be played in either ASCII or SDL modes.

Only ASCII version supported unless someone tells me how to compile SDL in pascal.
