Listen to the water
that surrounds our shore -
To the wind
that blows into our face -
To the stories they tell
before all disappears in darkness

Tomas Hterin
Fare thee well, Adonthell

At first sight, everything looks peaceful on the island of Adonthell. But Tomas
Hterin's verse has become true in a way that no one would ever have expected.
Now there is an urgent need for someone to take a light into the darkness and
stand where even those of greater wisdom failed.

Perhaps you are the one who will save Adonthell and bring peace back to the
country.
