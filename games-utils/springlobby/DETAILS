SpringLobby is a free cross-platform lobby client for the Spring RTS project.
Features and goals:
    * Implemented in modern C++
    * Depends only on wxWidgets (later also boost) so works on many more
      platforms than spring itself.
    * License is GPL 2 (free as in freedom)
    * Clean and intuitive user interface
    * Full UTF-8 support
    * Clean design, clean codebase, well documented (soon at least)
