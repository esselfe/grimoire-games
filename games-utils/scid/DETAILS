With Scid you can maintain a database of chess games, search games by many 
criteria, view graphical trends, and produce printable reports on players 
and openings. You can also analyze games with the chess program Scidlet or 
any other WinBoard-compatible chess engine, and even use Scid to study 
endings with endgame tablebases. There are many more features as well.
