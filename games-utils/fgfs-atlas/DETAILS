Atlas aims to produce and display high quality charts of the world for users
of FlightGear, an open source flight simulator. This is achieved through
two main parts: The map creator (simply called Map) and the Atlas viewer.

The map creator takes scenery data from FlightGear and transforms it into
beautiful map pictures that can be viewed with any bitmap image program that
you might have installed or with the Atlas viewing application.

The Atlas viewing application can be used for browsing your maps but can also
connect directly to FlightGear and display your aircrafts current location
on a so called moving map display.
