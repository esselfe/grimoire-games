The WorldForge Update Tool (WFUT) is designed to provide a generic software
update tool for WorldForge applications. It is intended to provide media
updates for WorldForge clients, although any content hosted on a web server can
be used. It was originally written in Java for ease of implementation and
portability, although there is now a C++ implementation intended for use
withing client applications.

WFUT defines a collection of files as a channel. Each channel has a XML file
defined listing each file (and directory), a version number (used to notify the
client that a local file is out of date) and a CRC32 checksum (used for
download verification and file change detection).
