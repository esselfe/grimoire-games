GtkEveMon is an EVE-Online skill monitoring standalone application for
GNU/Linux systems. With GtkEveMon you can monitor your current skills and your
skill training process without starting EVE-Online. You will never miss to
train your next skill!

GtkEveMon is inspired by EveMon, a character monitor and skill planner for
Microsoft's .NET framework. Reportedly EveMon also runs unter GNU/Linux with
Mono and some effort. GtkEveMon does not aim at being as powerful as EveMon but
rather a lightweight alternative. Many features of EveMon are not, and will
probably never be, implemented. However, you're welcome to make feature
requests in the forums.
