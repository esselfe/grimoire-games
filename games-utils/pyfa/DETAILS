cat << EOF
pyfa is the Python Fitting Assistant, a standalone application to create
fittings for the EVE-Online SciFi MMORPG. The application is available for
many platforms, see the download page for further details. The layout of pyfa
heavily based on EFT, the EVE fitting tool. Although it is a complete rewrite
and replacement for EFT, the fittings are still compatible with EFT.
