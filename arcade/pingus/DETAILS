While Pingus is based on the idea of Lemmings(tm), it has included some other ideas, which weren't 
presented in the original Lemmings(tm), like the worldmap or secret levels, which might be familiar 
from games the Super Mario World and other Nintendo games. We have also a few new actions, like the jumper 
which weren't presented in the original game.
