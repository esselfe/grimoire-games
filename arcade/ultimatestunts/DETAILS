UltimateStunts will be a remake of the famous DOS-game "stunts". This DOS-game, 
which was 
released in the early 1990's, can be downloaded on several abandonware sites, e.
g. the XTC 
site . It is a 3D racing game, with simple CGA/EGA/VGA graphics and no texture o
r smooth 
shading, but because of the spectacular stunts (loopings, bridges to jump over, 
etc.) it was 
really fun to play. One of the best aspects of this game is that it had a track 
editor. 
Because of the tile-based tracks, every gamer was able to make it's own tracks.

The remake won't become a DOS game: it will work on UNIX-compatible systems (lik
e Linux), 
and on windows. It will also provide more modern features, like openGL graphics,
 3D sound 
and internet multiplaying.
The current version is still in a pre-alpha fase, so you shouldn't expect much o
f it, but 
the screenshots give a nice impression of how the game will look.
