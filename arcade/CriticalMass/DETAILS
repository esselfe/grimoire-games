Critical Mass (Critter) is an SDL/OpenGL space shoot'em up game. 
Your world has been infested by an aggressive army of space critters.
Overrun and unprepared, your government was unable to defend its
precious resources. As a last effort to recapture some of the
'goodies', you have been placed into a tiny spacecraft and sent after 
them.
