cat << EOF
Aleph One is an Open Source 3D first-person shooter game, based on the game
Marathon 2 by Bungie Software.  It supports, but doesn't require, OpenGL for
rendering.  Aleph One was originally a MacOS-only game, but I'm working on a
cross-platform version based on the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library,
that should eventually run on all systems supported by SDL (Linux, BeOS,
Windows, MacOS, Solaris, IRIX, *BSD, and others).
