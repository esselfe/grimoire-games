The Freedoom project aims to create a complete free content first person
shooter game. But Freedoom by itself is just the raw material for a game:
it must be paired with a compatible game engine to be played.

id Software released the source code to their classic game, Doom, under the
GNU GPL license. This means that the program code that powers Doom is free;
Freedoom complements this with free levels, artwork, sound effects and music
to make a completely free game.

Freedoom is actually three games in one, consisting of two single player
campaigns and one set of levels intended for multiplayer deathmatch (FreeDM).

Freedoom aims to be compatible with DOOM mods, and allows most to be played
without the need to use non-free software.

Freedoom contains hundreds of original textures, sound effects and music
tracks that can be reused royalty-free by Doom level authors and other
independent game developers.
