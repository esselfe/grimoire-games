cat << EOF
Flight of the Amazon Queen (often just called FOTAQ) was created by Brisbane-
based Interactive Binary Illusions (IBI) (now defunct) in the early nineties.
After four years of development it was finally released in 1995 with the Amiga
version being developed first and then the game being ported to MS-DOS.

The gameplay follows the style of much-acclaimed LucasArts classics like Monkey
Island or the Indiana Jones games. Just like in most LucasArts games it is not
actually possible to die nor to get stuck. Moreover, well written dialogues
with lots of puns and sarcastic remarks as well as beautifully hand-drawn
graphics shape this game.
