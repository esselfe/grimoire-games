Fish Fillets is strictly a puzzle game. The goal in every of the seventy
levels is always the same:  find a safe way out. The fish utter witty remarks
about their surroundings, the various inhabitants of their underwater realm
quarrel among themselves or comment on the efforts of your fish. Theese are
data for the game.
