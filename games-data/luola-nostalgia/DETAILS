cat << EOF
These levels are (unofficial) remakes of the old V-Wing levels. They are not
exact copies, but are made to look almost exactly like the originals (though I
have taken some artistic liberties in some places). The largest differences are
in the collisionmaps, some areas of flowing water, explosives, burning terrain
and of course hidden features might be quite different
