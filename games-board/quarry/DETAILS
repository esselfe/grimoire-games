Quarry is a multi-purpose GUI for several board games, at present Go, Amazons
and Reversi (a.k.a. Othello.) It allows users to play against computer players
(third-party programs, e.g. GNU Go or GRhino) or other humans, view and edit
game records. Future versions will also support Internet game servers and
provide certain features for developers of board game-playing engines for
enhancing their programs.
