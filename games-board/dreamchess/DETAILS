DreamChess is an open source chess game.

DreamChess features 3D OpenGL graphics and provides various chess board sets,
ranging from classic wooden to flat figurines.

A moderately strong chess engine is included: Dreamer. However, should this
engine be too weak for you, then you can use any other XBoard-compatible chess
engine, including the popular Crafty and GNU Chess.

Other features include music, sound effects, on-screen move lists using SAN
notation, undo functionality, and savegames in PGN format.
