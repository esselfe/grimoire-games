Probably the most familiar 3D chess variant to the general public in the early
21st century is the game of Tri-Dimensional Chess (Tri-D Chess), which can be
seen in many Star Trek TV episodes and movies, starting with the original
series and proceeding in updated forms throughout the subsequent movies and
spinoff series.
