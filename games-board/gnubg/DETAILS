GNU Backgammon (GNUbg) plays and analyzes backgammon games and matches. It is
able to play and analyze both money games and tournament matches, evaluate
and roll out positions, and more. Driven by a command-line interface,
it displays an ASCII rendering of a board on text-only terminals, but also
allows the user to play games and manipulate positions with a graphical GTK+
interface. GNU Backgammon is extensible on platforms which support Python.

GNU Backgammon is a world class opponent and rates at over 2000 on FIBS,
the First Internet Backgammon Server.
