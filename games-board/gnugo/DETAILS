GNU Go has played thousands of games on the NNGS Go server. GNU Go is now also
playing regularly on the Legend Go Server in Taiwan, on the WING server in
Japan, and many volunteers run GNU Go clients on KGS. GNU Go has established
itself as the leading non-commercial go program in the recent tournaments that
it has taken part in.
