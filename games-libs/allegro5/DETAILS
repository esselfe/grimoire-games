Allegro is a cross-platform library mainly aimed at video game and multimedia
programming. Handling common, low-level tasks such as creating windows,
accepting user input, loading data, drawing images, playing sounds, etc. and
generally abstracting away the underlying platform. However, Allegro is not
a game engine: you are free to design and structure your program as you like.

Allegro was started by Shawn Hargreaves in the mid-90's but has since received
contributions from hundreds of people over the net.

Allegro 5 is the latest major revision of the library, designed to take
advantage of modern hardware (e.g. hardware acceleration using 3D cards)
and operating systems. Although it is not backwards compatible with earlier
versions, it still occupies the same niche and retains a familiar style.

Allegro 5.0 supports the following platforms:

    Unix/Linux Windows (MSVC, MinGW) MacOS X iPhone

Allegro 5.1 also adds support for:

    Android

Allegro only supports 2D graphics primitives natively, but it is perfectly
reasonable to use Allegro alongside a 3D API (e.g. OpenGL, Direct3D, and
higher level libraries), while Allegro handles the other tasks. Allegro is
also designed to be modular; e.g. if you prefer, you can substitute another
audio library.
