cat << EOF
SDLmm is a C++ glue for SDL, or the Simple DirectMedia Layer, which is a generic API that provides 
low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, 3D hardware via OpenGL, and 2D framebuffer 
across multiple platforms. 
SDLmm aims to stay as close as possible to the C API while taking advantage of native C++ features 
like object orientation. We will also aim at being platform independent as much as possible. I.e 
we'll try to support ever platform supported by SDL.
