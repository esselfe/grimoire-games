cat << EOF
Lib765 is the floppy controller emulation from JOYCE,
separately packaged. It is (in some sense) the reverse
of LibDsk; it converts uPD765a commands into LibDsk API
calls. It should come in handy if you're writing a PCW,
CPC or Spectrum+3 emulator; if you want to use it in a PC
emulator, you'll need to add features such as DMA.
