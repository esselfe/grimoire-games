'wftk' means 'WorldForge Toolkit': a widget library, written in C++, that is designed to allow quick, easy creation and management of GUI applications.  The wftk logo, to the right, depicts a hammer and wrench in stained glass - tools used to decorate a window.

'wftk' is a fork of the 'libuta' library, based off the 0.4.4 release. Like libuta, wftk uses SDL for video display, SDL_mixer for audio playback (mp3, ogg, and wav capable), libpng for surface I/O, libsigc++ for signal / callback functionality, and freetype for anti-aliased font rendering.
