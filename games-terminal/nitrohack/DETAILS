NitroHack is a modernized, network-capable fork of the classic roguelike
game NetHack.

NitroHack is a single player dungeon exploration game. Unlike many other
Dungeons & Dragons-inspired games, the emphasis in NitroHack is on discovering
the detail of the dungeon and not simply killing everything in sight -
in fact, killing everything in sight is a good way to die quickly.

Each game presents a different landscape - the random number generator
provides an essentially unlimited number of variations of the dungeon and
its denizens to be discovered by the player in one of a number of characters:
you can pick your race, your role, and your gender.

The ultimate goal of the game is to ascend the character. This is a very
difficult feat which many players never achieve.
