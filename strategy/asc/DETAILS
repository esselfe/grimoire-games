ASC is a free, turn based strategy game. It is designed in the tradition of the Battle Isle series 
from Bluebyte and is currently available for Windows and Linux.
 ASC is distributed under the terms of the Gnu General Public License (the license Linux uses too), 
which basically means the game is free, the complete source code is available and you can do 
everything with it as long as it remains free.
