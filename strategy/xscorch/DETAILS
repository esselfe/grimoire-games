Xscorch is a clone of the classic DOS game "Scorched Earth". The basic
goal is to annihilate enemy tanks using overpowered guns. Players can
purchase weapons and accessories to defend their tank, and they can
attack enemy tanks by adjusting the angle of the tank's turret and the
firing power. Xscorch supports gameplay with humans and computer AIs,
and network gameplay is in development.
