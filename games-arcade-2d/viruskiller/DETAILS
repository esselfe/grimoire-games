cat << EOF
Your computer has been invaded! Dozens of little viruses are 
pouring in via security holes in Microsoft Internet Explorer, 
Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft MSN Messenger and Microsoft Recycle Bin!! 
Using your trusty mouse you must shoot the buggers before they 
can destroy your files! Some will steal them from their home 
directories and take them back to their security hole. 
Others will just eat them right there on the spot! See how long 
you and your computer can survive the onslaught!
