Bygfoot is a football (a.k.a. soccer) management game.
Bygfoot allows you to manage a team by training the players, buying and selling
them, contracting loans, maintaining the stadium, etc. You can be promoted or
relegated, even become a champion. It includes a "team editor" which you can
use to create your own teams or edit the existing ones. The game is
deliberately kept simple (though not easy): you only have to keep one eye at
your players and another at your stadium.
