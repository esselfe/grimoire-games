Remake of the old DOS game Paratrooper

Paratim (Paratrooper Improved) is a remake of the old DOS game Paratrooper.
You play with the gun in the bottom center of the game while helicopters
fly overhead. Those helicopters sometimes drop paratroopers. When their
are four or more paratroopers on one side of the gun it's game over. To
prevent this you have to shoot the paratroopers while they fall and/or the
helicopters. After a round of helicopters planes arrive that drop bombs aimed
at the gun. If a bomb hits you it's game over as well. To prevent this you
have to shoot the bomb and/or the airplanes.

Currently, the game is playable, but much of the planned improvements have
yet to be implemented.
