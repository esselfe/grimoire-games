Hedgewars, it's a Blast! This is the funniest and most addictive game you'll
ever play - hilarious fun that you can enjoy anywhere, anytime. Hedgewars is
a turn based strategy game but the real buzz is from watching the devastation
caused by those pesky hedgehogs with those fantastic weapons - sneaky little
blighters with a bad attitude!
