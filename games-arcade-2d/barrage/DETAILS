Barrage is a rather violent action game with the objective to kill and
destroy as many targets as possible within 3 minutes. You control a gun that
may either fire small or large grenades at soldiers, jeeps and tanks. Targets
are fast paced and require careful aiming as it takes half a second to reload
the gun. Additionally you have to keep an eye on your ammo and reload in
time. Useful to kill some minutes of idle time. :) And yes, the graphics
look similiar to Command&Conquer but they are self-pixeled. I just used
a screenshot of C&C as sketch. And no, none of the sounds are taken from
C&C. (I don't even know how they sound as the German version has silent
bots. I never managed to find a Bloodpatch. :-/) I created all by myself
except for the fonts which come from Karl Bartel.
