(Pronunciation: just like Armageddon, just with a "tr" instead of the "dd".)
In this game, you ride a lightcycle around the game grid. You can only make
sharp turns of 90 degrees and a wall constantly builds up after you. Make your
enemies crash into your wall, but be aware that they are trying to do the same
to you.  Only if you are fast enough, you may be able to trap them; but the only
way to speed up your lightcycle is to drive close to the dangerous walls.
Prepare for exciting strategic preparations followed by action-packed close
combat!
