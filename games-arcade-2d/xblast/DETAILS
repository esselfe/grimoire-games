XBlast is a multi-player arcade game for X11R5/R6 (v2.6 or TNT) and Windows (TNT version only). The game can be played with at least two players and up to six players. It was inspired by the video/computer game Bomberman (Dynablaster), which was to my knowledge first programmed for NEC's PC Engine/Turbo Grafx. Other commercial versions of the original game exist for IBM-PC, Atari ST, Amiga [trop cool l'Amiga], NES, GameBoy and Super NES.
