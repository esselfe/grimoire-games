Have you ever thought that Tetris is evil because it never sends you that
straight "I" brick you need to clear four rows? Well, Tetris(R) probably is
not so malevolent, but Bastet certainly is.

Bastet stands for "bastard tetris", and is a simple ncurses-based Tetris(R)
clone for Linux. Instead of choosing the next block randomly, this fiendish
program uses a special algorithm to give you the worst possible brick. Playing
Bastet can be a very frustrating experience!
