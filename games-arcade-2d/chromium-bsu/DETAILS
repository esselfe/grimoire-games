You are captain of the cargo ship Chromium B.S.U., responsible for delivering
supplies to our troops on the front line. Your ship has a small fleet of
robotic fighters which you control from the relative safety of the Chromium
vessel.

y  o  u  r    m  i  s  s  i  o  n
Do not let ANY enemy ships get past your fighters! Each enemy ship that makes
it past the bottom of the screen will attack the Chromium, and you lose a
fighter.Use your fighters as weapons! Crash into enemies to destroy them
before they can get past you.  Strategic suicide is a powerful tactic! When
the Chromium launches a new fighter, it releases a high energy burst which
destroys all enemies in range.  Self-destruct to preserve your ammunition! A
double-right-click will cause your current fighter to self-destruct. Before
the ship blows up, it ejects its ammunition so that the next fighter can
pick it up.
