Airstrike is a 2d dogfighting game being slowly developed by various people
around the net. It is not yet playable although there is an old version which
may be a bit fun to try. We are developing the game using only freely available
tools, and we try to do everything ourselves. The source code and the 3d models
are released under the GPL licence.
Features include alpha blended raytraced graphics and accurate physics. We are
working on making it fun to play; all help is welcome.
