A real-time, excessive Worms-clone

A game like the famous Liero. Indeed, it is based on the source of LieroX.

Your character is a worm (or similars) and you have to shoot other worms
around you. You have an huge arsenal of weapons to do this. You have also
a ninja-rope to get fast from one point to another.

The game has an active internet-comunity and an ingame-serverlist, so can
easily join other net-games. On the other hand, there are bots available,
so you can also play alone.
