A platformer with some puzzle elements.

Ballz is a platformer with some puzzle elements. You take control of a ball
which is genetically modified by the British secret service. Your mission
is to rescue captured British soldiers from a prison in Iran.

The game was in 72 hours for the TINS competition, a competition similar
to Speedhack. The name TINS is an recursive acronym for ‘TINS is not
Speedhack’.
