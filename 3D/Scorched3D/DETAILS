cat << EOF
In its simplest form Scorched is an artillery game. Tanks take turns to earn
money by destroying opponents in an arena. Scorched attempts to recreate the
simple yet addictive game play of the original game, adding amongst other new
features a 3D island environment and LAN and internet play.
